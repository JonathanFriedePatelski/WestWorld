Today update â€“ 09/06/2023

Raymon has successfully installed and integrated the Laravel Breeze package, which offers
a comprehensive authentication system along with associated views. Several style and
content modifications were implemented within the dashboard, seamlessly integrated into
Breeze's layouts and components. To streamline development and maintain a clean commit
history, numerous feature branches were consolidated through pull requests. Furthermore,
branch protection settings and pull request merge strategies were adjusted to enhance the
enforcement of a linear commit history, significantly improving the development process.
Additionally, installation instructions have been included in the readme file.

Bart has been working on the front-end for the event page and using Figma for the "crews" page.

Jonathan has made significant progress in converting the dashboard design into
a functional PHP file. While he encountered some difficulties getting Tailwind CSS to work
initially due to a prior issue with his computer, he successfully resolved the problem
with the assistance of the team and a coach.

Today, Wessel made strides in database management for his Laravel project. He worked on
creating and refining database seeders and factories for various models, including users,
crews, and hovercrafts. Wessel also fine-tuned Enum classes to enhance data integrity. He
feels that the team is making great progress and is optimistic about the road ahead.
