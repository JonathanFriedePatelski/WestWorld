Progress Update: September 7, 2023

Raymon:

Raymon worked on completing the setup of the database side of the application. This included refactoring seeders, models, migrations, and factories. He also set up resource controllers and routing for index view actions for the majority of the major database entities. Additionally, he created some basic HTML templates to serve as a starting point for developing a more polished design.

Wessel:

Wessel made significant layout adjustments within the Laravel framework and successfully resolved a bug related to the IncidentSeeder. Additionally, Wessel made minor tweaks throughout the project for optimization and approved several merge requests.

Bart:

Today, everything went wrong. There were merge conflicts in the code, and there were some issues with the view, but they have been fixed.

Jonathan:

Today, Jonathan worked from home until 13:15 due to an unexpected appointment involving another family member, which required him to babysit the dogs. While at home, he attempted to work on the tasks discussed during a previous Discord call but found himself easily distracted. From 13:15 onwards, Jonathan continued his work from school and encountered unforeseen conflicts. However, he was able to resolve these issues with the assistance of a coach. In summary, Jonathan wasn't able to make significant progress on his tasks today.
