Today – 09/04/2023 – we got of to a bit of a rough start. We had to wait a bit for the
entire team to assemble and the presentations to finish. Then it turned out the wifi was
unmanageable. We chose to relocate to a teammate's house (with Joris' and Karen approval,
naturally) and work from there. We proceeded to set up the team page, and read the
provided material. We set up a git repository on Bitlab. We had a brief brainstorming
session, we made an initial draft for the project plan, we set up a kanban board on the
bitlab repository. Of course, we documented everything. It took a bit to get
settled, and we missed both our deadlines by a couple of hours, but considering the
delays, we rallied admirably.
