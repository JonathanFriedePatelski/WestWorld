### Description

The Digital Desperado's Incident Management System is a web platform where Delos Incident
crews log in to view ongoing incidents in an interactive map. They can then assign
incidents to themselves, allowing them to update the incidents' status. Upon completion
they submit a complete incident report. All of this is tracked in the application's
database, fuelling future data driven insights.

### Purpose

The purpose of DD Incident Management System is to provide incident crews with a way to
clearly divide tasks amongst themselves, as well as record data on incidents to help
prevent them in the future.
