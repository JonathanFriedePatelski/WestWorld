### Working together with Jonathan

Jonathan did a good job looking for a niche – namely frontend and design – in which to
contribute. It's hard to work in team using technologies you're not familiar with.

### Extra feedback

I think it's impressive you strove to quietly power through the tasks you took on, but
it's also good to speak about your own wishes. A project like this can be an opportunity
to learn. If you're curious about something, you may ask to do it with some help.
